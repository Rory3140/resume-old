      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an enthusiastic, outgoing, and overall positive person with an eagerness to learn and embrace new
        challenges. My passion for technology has been with me for as long as I can remember, but since learning Java
        six
        years ago I have been encapsulated by the idea of creative freedom and the opportunity for critical thinking
        development and coding gives you, driving me to not only pursue a career in the field but also teach myself
        various essential languages and expanding my understanding.<br>

        <br>While coding is my true passion, I am far from a typical Computer Science student. I am also an avid rugby
        player,
        having represented my country with Ireland U19 and currently playing for both my university and the New York
        Academy. My experience in rugby has taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, perseverance, and leadership,
        all
        of
        which I bring to the table when working with others on coding projects.

        <h2>Java</h2>
        <p>I have been coding in java for over six years now, making it the programming language I am most proficient
          in. Over the years, I have completed numerous projects in Java, which range from simple and advanced
          algorithms to a quiz application completed using Java Swing which boasts a comprehensive login and
          registration system, as well as seamless integration with a back-end database.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="python-content" class="content">
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>I picked up Python myself at secondary school and continued it in university. I enjoy using Python for web
          automation and creating customized scripts to streamline processes.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="cplus-content" class="content">
        <h2>C++</h2>
        <p>Through self-teaching, I have gained a strong understanding of C++ and its similarities to Java have allowed
          me to quickly adapt to coding at a high level. I have used C++ mainly for developing applications and game
          development, which has allowed me to utilize my skills in creative and practical ways. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="html-content" class="content">
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>I initially learnt HTML through the web development class I took at university, and I am continually drawn to
          its creative potential. I have utilized HTML alongside CSS and JavaScript to create projects like this resume
          which I coded from scratch.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="css-content" class="content">

          projects.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="javascript-content" class="content">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>I first gained exposure to JavaScript in my web development class at university where I learned the
          fundamentals of the language. Since then I have taught myself more advanced aspects of JavaScript to
          complete various front-end and back-end projects.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="sql-content" class="content">
        <h2>Oracle SQL</h2>
        <p>I began learning Oracle SQL in secondary school to use for database projects and since then I have taken a
          Database Management Systems class at university which has further expanded my understanding of SQL and
          databases.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="selenium-content" class="content">
        <h2>Selenium</h2>
        <p>Selenium has been my preferred choice for all of my web automation projects, and I have utilized it with both
          Java and Python.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="node-content" class="content">
        <h2>Node.js</h2>
        <p>I began learning Node.js when I was exploring the capabilities of JavaScript, and I have since utilized it
